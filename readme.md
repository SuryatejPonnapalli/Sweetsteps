# 🍬 SweetSteps – A Gamified Habit Builder for Kids

> Turning Chores into Rewards, One Candy at a Time! 🍭

SweetSteps is a fun, interactive mobile/web app designed to help parents build good habits in children aged 5–10 through a gamified reward system. Kids complete tasks assigned by parents to earn candy points, unlock BigCandies, and redeem them for toy rewards. The app transforms boring chores into a sweet adventure!

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Parents often struggle to get young children to complete daily tasks like cleaning, brushing, or studying. Traditional methods feel like punishment rather than motivation.

**SweetSteps** solves this by making chores fun and rewarding — using points, achievements, and a virtual toy store to build good habits.

**🍯 Why "SweetSteps"? – Interpreting the Theme**
This project was built under the hackathon theme “SUGAR”, which we interpreted in a unique and meaningful way.

Just like sugar symbolizes sweetness, innocence, and energy, young kids are in their most pure and formative stage — full of curiosity and potential. However, in today’s digital world, children often get caught up in passive habits like endless scrolling or screen time with little value.

SweetSteps aims to channel that raw sweetness into something nourishing and productive. By encouraging kids to complete tasks that stimulate their brains and build responsibility, we help parents guide them toward a healthier, smarter future.

In essence, we’re turning "sugar" into a symbol of smart, active growth — where every sweet step builds a better tomorrow for both the child and the parent.
